# Software Requirements

## Vision

Our application will be a convenient resource for a user to see what live music options are available in their area of choosing. They can then save the options that are appealing to them and view them later for review and scheduling. This project solves the pain point of not knowing of events that are happening in the area, particularly live music! Our product will allow the user to spend less time searching and more time having fun. This is why you should care about our app: because your time is valuable!

## Scope

### In

- The web app will provide information to the users about all of the different live music events in the area
- The web app will provide three search options for the user: by artist, by location, by venue
- The user will be able to store desired results for later viewing and record
- The user will be able to update their stored results in the case they no longer want to attend the event

### Out

- This website will never be an iOS or Android app

## Minimum Viable Product

Our Minimum viable product will be a web app with a landing page that allows the user to create a username and password. Upon logging into the site, it will take the user to the home page which will display a form. The form can be used to search for local music options. The music options will be displayed in a carousel on the home page. Each element will have a button that will give them the option to save it to their searches page and will also have a music sample for the users to listen to. On the searches page their stored results will be displayed in a carousel with two buttons delete and update. Lastly, there will be a page called "Our Team" that will display information about the developers.

## Stretch

Our stretch goals for this app are as follows:

- Display the location of the event on a map using locationIQ

The searches page will have options to update or delete the saved results which will also update the database.
